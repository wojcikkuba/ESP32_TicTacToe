**ESP32 Tic Tac Toe with Live Server and TFT Display**

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game on an ESP32 microcontroller. The game leverages the ESP32's Wi-Fi capabilities to host a web server that allows players to follow moves through a live webpage. The state of the board is displayed in real-time and updates automatically as players take their turns.

The main features of this project include:

- ESP32-based implementation: Utilizes the versatile ESP32 microcontroller for game logic, display handling, and network connectivity.
- TFT Display Support: Displays the game board on a connected TFT display, providing a visual interface directly on the hardware.
- Live Game Updates: Hosts a web server accessible via Wi-Fi, allowing remote gameplay with automatic live updates of the board state.
- Simple and Clean Web UI: A lightweight web interface to make moves, reset the game, and view the current game state in real-time.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of the ESP32 in combining embedded hardware control with responsive web-based interfaces for fun and interactive projects.
